# Data sourced from rdss
See ELN for experimental details.

Data for analysis is obtained through my own experimental work. The data is stored on the lab RDSS drive. I have copied and pasted the data folder
through the GUI. The folder is titled with experiment date and each FCS file is
labeled with experimental conditions. These labels were generated during the
experiment. If you would like to recieve a copy of the data, please contact me at
hanxi-tang@uiowa.edu.
